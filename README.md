## Introduction

This repository contains the basic code and slides for an introduction to the basics of graphs, with a particular emphasis on data science.  

### How to run the code here

You will need to set up a Neo4j database and JupyterLab.  For the sake of this demonstration, you can follow the instructions at my blog post ["Get going with Neo4j and JupyterLab through Docker"](https://dev.neo4j.com/docker_neo_jupyter).  The repository for this post can be found [here](https://github.com/cj2001/data_science_neo4j_docker).  The only thing you will need to do then is to move the Jupyter notebook in this repo into the `notebooks/` subdirectory of that repository.
